  <h2>How it all began..</h2>
  <p>In April 2016, my boyfriend and I were lucky enough to get a plot at a community garden in South Austin.  After a trip to the garden festival and to the <a href="http://www.naturalgardeneraustin.com/" target="_blank">The Natural Gardener</a> we were in business.  This is the first garden I've ever had!  We knew that growing things in Texas would be very different from growing things in Virginia, where we recently moved from.  As soon as we bought some transplants, we got digging!</p>
  <h3>What is a community garden anyway?</h3>
  <p>A community garden is a plot of land </p>
