    <h2>How it all began..</h2>
      <p>In April 2016, my boyfriend and I were lucky enough to get a plot at a community garden in South Austin.  After a trip to the garden festival and to the <a href="http://www.naturalgardeneraustin.com/" target="_blank">The Natural Gardener</a> we were in business.  This is the first garden I've ever had!  We knew that growing things in Texas would be very different from growing things in Virginia, where we recently moved from.  As soon as we bought some transplants, we got digging!</p>

    <h2>What is a community garden anyway?</h2>
      <p>Community gardens are organized in various ways.  The one I belong to has individual plots, as well as some community plots.  We pay a small fee every few months and complete work hours to keep our plot.  For work hours, sometimes I weed or mow the common areas of the garden.  Everyone is free to grow <b>whatever</b> they want to in their own individual plot.</p>

    <h2>Best parts of having a garden</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Fresh vegetable year-round</li>
        <li>An easy way to connect to your food</li>
        <li>Great way to relieve stress</li>
        <li>An excuse to get outdoors</li>
        <li>It is beneficial to the environment</li>
      </ul>

  <h3>A similar website</h3>
  <p><a href="http://www.bhg.com/gardening/vegetable/vegetables/planning-your-first-vegetable-garden/">This</a> is a similar website.  It is <em>obviously</em> much more advanced than my website.  This site is styled with css.  It also have interactive tabs at the top of the page.  There are definitely a few of the same html elements on this site as are on mine.  This site makes use of links, both to other websites and to relative pages on the website.  I can tell that heading elements of various sizes are used, and of course paragraphs.  There are many images on the website.  Some of the words are in bold, but I am not sure if they are styled using html or css.  Since my website isn't cluttered with advertisements, I would argue that it's a little better in that sense :) Other than that, this website that I linked to is <b>pretty</b> good.</p>
